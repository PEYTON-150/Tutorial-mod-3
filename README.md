For this assignment you will extend your previous assignment 1 to include the following:

Two images of your choice (e.g. Butler logo, photo of yourself, etc.) with a message next to each image.
Include a button that allows the user to toggle between images and messages displayed.
Use Stacks to vertically and horizontally space out the images and other text included on the screen.
Feel free to use your own layout, format, colors and motif to make the UI aesthetically pleasing and user friendly.
